## üí° Purpose
Practice and reinforce understanding of Java OOP concepts through real-world-style examples. This includes:
- Encapsulation and constructors
- Composition and reuse
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interface implementation
- Abstract class design
- Custom class development and testing

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
3. Compile and run individual `.java` files under each folder
